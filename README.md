# PageRank-python

This project is a python project. It will implement Google's original PageRank algorithm.

**Objective:**

The main objective of the project is to **define as precisely as possible the PageRank algorithm** used by Google. We will implement the code in Python using NumPy. In this simulation, we'll try to define and observe the influence of each parameter on the final result.


**Context:**

This project is a school project for the Data Science course of Pierres Desesquelles at Polytech Paris-Saclay (2019-2020)
